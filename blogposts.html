        <p>I’m 75% of the way through the Makers Academy precourse, so I thought today would be a good chance to step back and reflect on the precourse so far.</p>

        <p>Although I at beginning of my ‘coding journey’ I have picked up some valuable lessons that I didn’t think I would so early in the Makers course. They say when you’re a beginner you don’t know what you don’t know - I have come to realise this to be truer now more than ever as I make my way through the chapters there’s content that although I had been familiar with during the code academy course, but having it explained highlights exactly all the knowledge gaps along the way, I have a feeling I’ll be picking up a lot of this throughout the course.</p>

        <p><b>Week1</b></p>
        <p>Commandline week was super interesting because although I had been using this for the past year in my job and never knew the reasons I was typing the same things into Terminal at work, but this was all clearly explained in the course. After week 1, I reached out to my now mentor Nima. I hoped for Nima to be my mentor for a few reasons, his bio mentioned things like “anyone can code online, but that won’t make you a better developer” and “you’ll really learn the value of collaboration” - for personal reasons these things stuck out to me because they’re the reasons why I joined Makers so after a message to Nima explaining why I think he’d make a great mentor, he kindly agreed to mentor me and we set up a zoom call.</p>

        <p>It was great to speak openly about why we both joined Makers and we realised that we both had a similar past in coding experience - he had been working as a Software Engineer previously but wanted to learn from the ground up, which was great because I was exactly the same. I had read his blog and he wrote about how his confidence had grown after 6 weeks on the course, so I shared with him that I looked forward to to experiencing this boost in confidence too. After a great first call with Nima, I asked him what he would advise himself 2 cohorts ago and one of they key things he mentioned was to “embrace your cohort” which was interesting as I hadn't really spoken to anybody on the course yet, so I took this on board, along with lots of other helpful top tips!</p>

        <p><b>Weeks 2 & 3</b></p>
        <p>It had been suggested to us to compete chapters 1-10 within a 2 week period, judging by chttps://www.joanne-young.co.uk/#bloghapters 1-5 I had been thinking this was very manageagle so by the second week I started on the second half of the mastery quizzes and found that the challenges (as mentioned by the coaches)  were getting much harder so what perfect opportunity to do as Nima suggested - embrace the cohort. After completing the C6 quizzes, a few of the others from my cohort set a code share and this was really interesting to see other points of view. I saw that others were calling methods, and this made me want to up my ‘code’ game, and switch to calling methods. For chapter 7, I wanted to make my code as clever as possible but in the process I overcomplicated it in my head. This was a mistake and it took me days to make progress on one of the quizzes in C7 - I hit a roadblock. I reached out for help in my cohort (going through the chain of command) and Tanil helped me figure out the my algorithm in a pairing session - this was extremely valuable and helped me highlight where I was going wrong which I was super grateful for, not only in my code but my approach to tackling problems.</p>

        <p><b>My top valuable lessons so far:</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Plan and Plan again.</b> During my pairing session with Tanil, he mentioned to me that I hadn’t put the pen to paper much for this challenge - he was right. I had planned it in my head (no wonder I couldn’t sleep properly, I was thinking of objects and methods overnight!) and although I wrote a simple flow chart… I didn’t plan out he hardest part of the challenge which was the algorithm. I identified this trait of mine where I get ahead of myself, but i’m glad it’s come to my attention so that I can overcome it. Together we wrote it out on paper and seeing it visually aided the logical thinking behind what was happening.  </li>
          <li><b>Use the test documentation.</b> During the pairing session we used the testing documentation as our ’test cases’ to see if the algorithm would work and it was a really good way of working. Also it helped clarify the brief more as I could see what I should expect the output to be,
          <li><b>Use a simple REPL.</b>During the pairing session, Tanil used www.repl.it, whilst I had been using terminal and VSC which is ok to use, but for ease I could use something like this to speed up the feedback loop, therefore makes the process easier overall. I had been using terminal throughout so was sure that I am able to understand and use this. </li>
          <li><b>Read the articles on the Makers Academy blog.</b>These were genuinely really helpful in making me realise where I had been going wrong. The series by Marcus Gardiner here - https://medium.com/@marcusfgardiner, was really great it helping me get my mind back in the game after what was a huge learning curve in Chapter 7. </li>
          <li><b>Start simple.</b> Go for the easiest solution first that works, then refactor. I was inspired by the code share and wanted to complete the ‘coolest, most amazing’ looking code but I didn’t even understand what I was trying to achieve - start simple then refacor. A quote that stuck out to me from Marcus’ blog posts was “I’m so clever, I don’t even understand what I’m saying” - Oscar Wilde, and it really made me think. I have now learnt to break the problem down, and start small.</li>
          <li><b>Timeboxing.</b> don’t spend days trying to figure out a problem. Makers advise 20 mins being stuck on a problem, I wish I had known this sooner! A lot of time was wasted due to my stubborness to try and find a solution sooner - I spent a weekend churning out lots of different ’trial and error’ methods which was a total waste of time, I lost my weekend and I could have gotten help sooner. It’s ok to admit you’re stuck.</li>
        </ol>
      </br>
        <p><b>For Chapter 8 onwards…</b></p>
        <p>The most important thing I have learnt is planning , the day after the pairing session I woke up early read up on the Makers blogs and made a promise to myself to plan thoroughly before starting to code. Something that stuck in my mind was ‘If I had 6 hours to chop down a tree, I would spend 4 hours sharpening the axe” - and this theory worked! For the following 2 challenges after the learning curve, I read the question thoroughly, read the test documentation made sure I understood the question and shut my laptop up (for at least an hour) untill I came back to my laptop with a fully thought out solution, sometimes I would test some parts of my solution on repl.it and this was the best way of working - I was breaking up the problem and making it managable. I finished the day feeling like I’d really achieved not only the challenges for that day, but overall I was a better coder than I was than the day before, so it’s something I will carry through to the course and my career. </p>

        <p>
          On Monday I will be starting at the Makers Academy in London, for a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp. 
          I'm so happy to have this opportunity to enrol at such a great school, with an amazing curriculum, 
          coaches, facilities, career services and reputation. 
          I wanted to share on here exactly why I've signed up to join the March Makers cohort, and my motivations for doing so, 
          and to do that I think it's best to talk about the journey i've had so far. It feels like I've been building up to attend this school for some time, 
          so i want to briefly (very briefly) touch upon this. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Background</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          My interest in coding started in my teenage years whilst at school/sixth form. 
          I was a self-taught HTML/CSS enthusiast who loved the satisfaction of learning to build websites from scratch and seeing them live on the World Wide Web. 
          In 2010, I started my course in Digital Media (BA) at the University of Leeds, which covered aspects of Coding, Communication, User Interface Design, and Digital Business. 
          After graduating, I started my career in Project Management as I enjoyed being client facing, building relationships with stakeholders and working cross functionally in Ecommerce. 
          I always knew that I would one day pursue a career in Software engineering because I enjoyed the technical side of coding. In 2018, after 5 years as Technical Project Manager, 
          I considered my options to purse a Software Engineer career and requested a career change from my current employer - digital marketing agency in London. 
          They readily agreed to my requests and sponsored me to attend the General Assembly part-time course in front end development for 10 weeks. 
          During this course, I developed and honed new skills and refreshed old skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I started my journey as a front-end developer
          in 2019 with the agreement that I would be fully supported and mentored as I begin my new career.
          I had always been proactive to develop my skills and have done this in a number of ways, through working through Katas online (Codewars, Edibit, Codebyte), and completing online courses (Codeacademy and freeCodeCamp). 
          I regularly attend events such as Codebar/general meet ups and meeting with external mentors
        </p>  
        <p>
          Since starting my new career, my employer had undergone several business transformations which have resulted in my development in my chosen career path being somewhat halted or at least slowed. 
          I won't go too much into it but as a result of some business changes, my personal development suffered which in the world of software engineering is vital for any junior who is learning on the job. 
          I had sought mentorship and help outside of work but this did not work out as well as I would have liked it to. 
          My company announced that the company would cease operations and close in March 2020... I had attended a number of interviews, and as any developer will tell you - those technical tests are tricky and I felt overwhelmed with the masses I had to learn, it became clear that to seek a new role I really wanted I needed to do something... 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>So why Makers and why now?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have decided to enrol to acquire these foundation skills in order to learn Software Engineering from the ground up - backend, frontend and everything in between. 
          The Makers curriculum covers am extensive number of topics that interests me, and I believe after graduating from Makers I will be fully equipped to be able to find the right job for me as a Full Stack Engineer. 
          With my employment ending in March 2020, this will be the best investment long term career.
          Job hunting up until now has proven difficult as I am aware that I am lacking the foundations that make a great software engineer, but I fully believe that Makers will transform my career.
          I am keen to understand the key fundamentals that are required to secure the best possible opportunities i.e. object orientated programming, MVC model and Test Driven Development – I’m aware of the concepts but would like a deep understanding.
          After researching various code schools in London, along with attending the Makers demo days on and the tech forums today (events aimed at potential employers) 
          this has reinforced my decision that Makers is right for me. I personally like that Makers teaching methods are most like the real world - the workshops, projects and pair programming will be most beneficial as this is how I learn best. 
          Various colleagues had studied at Makers and have given glowing recommendation not only of the course but the careers services. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Makers Academy will help me change my redundancy from a negative to a positive and I am positive Makers will equip me for the world of Software Engineering.

      <div class="w-100">
        <h2 class="mb-5">Technical Skills</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript, Node and React - I have a variety of projects using full-stack capabilities and comfortable tackling efforts solo or working in collaborative groups</li>
          <li>RESTful APIs - I can build using REST to send and receive requests</li>
          <li>TDD approach - Makers Academy taught me the importance of honing a test drive approach to test functionality and behaviour first while maintaining high code coverage via unit tests and acceptance tests.</li>
          <li>Object Orientated Programming - Able to write code by breaking the objects into classes and methods/functions.</li>
          <li>Debugging - I have a calm and rational approach to debugging, by gaining visibility of the bug, and tightening the loop until fixed.</li>
          <li>Documentation writing - I can write clear and concise documentation for anything I write, allowing for the next developer to understand the code</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Maintenance and pipeline instrumentation</b> - I have deployed my projects using Github Marketplace actions
          <ul>
            <li>Codacy (checks code quality)</li>
            <li>Synk (checks for security vulnerabilities)</li>
            <li>Dependabot (automates dependency updates)</li>
          </ul>
          At Beamly I have previously used:
          <ul>
            <li>GoCD (pipeline instrumentation)</li>
            <li>Fastly (cache management)</li>
            <li>AWS: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) (cloud-computing platform)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>Passionate about UI:</b> During my time at Beamly my strengths were in being able to take a visual design in sketch, and transforming this into a fully functioning website/campaign page through Javascript, React and HTML/CSS, with pixel-perfect precision. I collaborated well with the UX team and was able to help meet the delivery deadlines which delighted clients. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Keen eye for detail</b> while re-platforming the legacy websites from WordPress to React, this required redirecting legacy URLs to the new URLs, this taught me about regular expressions as all redirects were implemented through a JSON file, and needed a keen eye for detail. Additionally, this was sometimes in Russian or Chinese, so required special attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Accessibility</b> - After Topshop was sued for lack of accessibility in 2018, this was due to alt images not having appropriate 'alt' tags and colour contrasting below satisfactory standards. I suggested to the next company I worked for that this be addressed to avoid any legal issues in future.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Performance</b> - While running site tests at Arcadia, I spotted that the images provided by the Design teams were huge and slowed site performance down. I suggested we reduce the imagery size (while not compromising quality) for faster site performance; This improved the website load speed by 50%.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>UAT testing, A/B testing</b> - While working at Arcadia, I was running site analytics on Adobe Omniture (homepage tracking report) every week. I noticed that the homepage hero's second and third image on the slider was not generating many clicks. Therefore no traffic was reaching those pages. We decided to run A/B testing to see if the website homepage could be improved, I coded a few different examples, and the analytics proved over the coming months that this was the right decision as the visitors preferred to see all imagery upon landing on the homepage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mobile-first mentality</b> - When building a website for a new client, I used my knowledge gained from General assembly. When queried on how to mobile optimise, I suggested we as developers use a triple nested flexbox as the design was in a grid-like format so would be the best approach. I had noticed that 80% of the audience was mobile users, so Mobile-first decisions should be at the forefront of decision making and flexbox allowed this. We built the website using mobile-first, and it launched in 2019.

        <p>Apart from being a web developer, I love staying fit and healthy by going to the gym. I am a member at At Your Beat Dance Studio and Base Dance studios, where I go to dance classes a few times a week via ClassPass. I also like to mix this up with Yoga and Pilates.</p>
        <p>I also dedicate some time to volunteering for a Charity - 'Reenage' a charity which organises meet ups with elders in my local area, in a bid to tackle loneliness in the community. Here I organise tea parties for small group in my area on the weekends.</p>
        <p>I have always been one for getting involved in multiple aspects of company life from social committees to Corporate Social Responsibility societies. I have been part of every social committee for every company I have worked for, even stemming back to university life where I was on the social secretary for the Leeds University Cheerleaders.</p>
